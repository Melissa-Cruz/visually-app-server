## About The Project


<!-- Insert a project screenshot here -->

This project has the back-end code for our personal project. The goal of the project is to implement a CRUD app  where the  user can create/add a new timeline to the collection, read and view the details of the timeline, update the timeline information and delete. This project was part of the coursework and is still a work in progress. 

The client side is deployed with Netlify and the server side with Render. 

### Future Tasks 
 - adjusting the sizing
 - changing the layout to a traditional asthetic
 - updating the form content
 - fixing the user login
 - rendering user entries
